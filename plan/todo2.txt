# 🧠 Full Tutorial Roadmap for Building AI-Powered TODO Assistant Agent

---

## 🎯 Goal

Learn how to progressively build a complete intelligent TODO assistant using **LLM (Local/OpenAI)** with **Node.js backend**.

---

# 📚 Tutorials List

---

## 1. Basic Task Prioritizer
- Create `/prioritize` endpoint.
- Send static list of tasks.
- Parse and show plain text priorities from LLM.

---

## 2. Smart Task Categorizer
- Categorize tasks into Urgent, Important, Low-priority.
- Output JSON:
```json
{ "urgent": [...], "important": [...], "later": [...] }
```

---

## 3. Short-Term Memory Agent
- Save last 5 outputs into a `memory.json` file.
- Load past memory into prompt every time.

---

## 4. Task Breakdown Agent
- Break big tasks (like "Plan vacation") into subtasks automatically.
- Output subtasks in JSON.

---

## 5. Action Recommendation Agent
- Detect urgent tasks and suggest actions like sending reminders.
- Output:
```json
{ "actions": [{ "type": "reminder", "task": "Submit taxes" }] }
```

---

## 6. Multi-Agent Simulation
- Simulate different agents:
  - `PrioritizerAgent`
  - `ReminderAgent`
  - `PlannerAgent`
- Each agent has own mini-prompt and task.

---

## 7. Natural Language Task Entry
- Accept user input like "Remind me to call mom tomorrow."
- LLM should convert it into structured task JSON.

---

## 8. Few-shot Example Prompting
- Embed 2-3 example input-output pairs inside the prompt.
- Make LLM more consistent and smarter.

---

## 9. Reasoning Explainer Agent
- Every task suggestion should have a "reason" field.
- Example:
```json
{ "task": "Submit project", "reason": "Deadline is tomorrow" }
```

---

## 10. Agent Autonomy (Self-Conversing Agent)
- After suggesting tasks, agent asks:
  > "Would you like me to schedule reminders?"

- Add follow-up handling logic.

---

# 🚀 Final Boss: Super TODO AI Agent

- Integrate all above modules:
  - Prioritize
  - Categorize
  - Plan
  - Remind
  - Memory
  - Conversation
  - Natural Language Understanding

- Create an actual full-fledged personal assistant powered by LLM.

# 🔥 How to work on each tutorial:

| Step | Action |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | Create an API endpoint `/api/xyz` |
| 2 | Build a dynamic prompt |
| 3 | Parse structured JSON output |
| 4 | (Optional) Store results in MongoDB or memory.json |
| 5 | Frontend connect kar sakte ho later |

---

# 🧠 Productivity Tip:

**Create a Trello board:**
- Each tutorial = One Trello card
- Mark ✅ after completing each agent skill

---

# 🏁 Conclusion

Working through this roadmap will teach you:
- LLM prompt engineering
- Memory management
- Modular agent building
- Multi-agent simulation
- Tool integration
