# 🧠 Roadmap: Building a Complete AI-Powered TODO Assistant Agent (LLM-based)

This document outlines the **step-by-step features and capabilities** you can build into your AI-powered TODO Assistant Agent.  
Perfect for learning and applying **prompt engineering**, **LLM integration**, and **agent-style thinking**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Create an intelligent TODO assistant that doesn't just manage tasks, but **thinks**, **reasons**, and **advises** the user — like a human productivity coach.

---

## 📚 Learning Plan (Feature by Feature)

### ✅ 1. **Basic Prompt Caller**
- Send tasks to LLM with a simple prompt.
- Get back a priority list as plain text.
- Use `fetch` and local LLM (Ollama or OpenAI).

> 🔁 You’ve already done this!

---

### 🧱 2. **Modular Prompt Builder**
- Move your prompt into a separate `promptBuilder.js`.
- Dynamically build it based on task properties (deadline, priority).
- Makes future logic expansion easy.

---

### 🧠 3. **Task Analyzer Agent**
- Add logic that categorizes tasks:
  - Urgent
  - Low-priority
  - Blocked
- Pass categories into the prompt.

---

### 🧠 4. **Context Memory (Short-Term)**
- Save LLM outputs to a file or DB.
- On next request, include “last 3 suggestions” as prompt input.
- Simulates agent memory.

---

### 🧠 5. **Structured JSON Output**
- Ask LLM to respond only in:
```json
{
  "prioritizedTasks": [],
  "skippedTasks": []
}
```
- Parse response using `JSON.parse()` safely.

---

### 🛠️ 6. **Tool Suggestion / Action Planner**
- Instruct the LLM: if a task is urgent → suggest “send reminder”.
- You can mock or actually connect this to an API.
- Example output:
```json
{
  "actions": [
    { "type": "reminder", "task": "Submit taxes" }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🧠 7. **Subtask Generator**
- Agent reads big tasks like “Plan vacation” and breaks them into subtasks.
- Output:
```json
{
  "task": "Plan vacation",
  "subtasks": ["Book flight", "Find hotel", "Make itinerary"]
}
```

---

### 🔀 8. **Multi-Agent Simulation**
- Add different agents:
  - `PlannerAgent`: breaks tasks
  - `PrioritizerAgent`: ranks tasks
  - `ReminderAgent`: identifies urgent items
- Each one has its own role + LLM prompt.

---

### 🧠 9. **LLM Reasoning Feedback**
- Show “why” a task was prioritized.
- Add “reason” in output:
```json
{
  "task": "Finish report",
  "reason": "Due tomorrow and high impact"
}
```

---

### 🌐 10. **Natural Language Task Entry**
- Accept input like: “Remind me to call mom before 6pm”
- Let LLM convert to structured task JSON:
```json
{
  "title": "Call mom",
  "deadline": "Today 6 PM"
}
```

---

### 🧠 11. **Few-shot Examples**
- Add example input/output in prompt to make LLM smarter.
- Improves stability + formatting of LLM output.

---

### 🚀 12. **Agent Autonomy Simulation**
- Add loop: let agent ask “Should I continue?” or “Do you want to reschedule?”
- Makes it behave like a real assistant, not just a calculator.

---

## 📌 Final Outcome

Your TODO AI agent will be able to:
- Understand context
- Prioritize like a productivity expert
- Handle natural language
- Suggest actions
- Evolve with experience
